                byte  streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported.

perror() ==> Prints a textual description of the error code currently stored in the system variable "errno" to "stderr".

in any manual page : 
at the below-most : type : "/patter-name" ==> ex: "/sock" ==> to search for sock keyword  ("" , is used just for highlighting )

for this tcp-ip structure 
we can also refer : "https://www.keypuncher.net/blog/network-sockets-in-c"

for socakaddr_in or sockaddr_on --STRUCTURE (DOCS NOT AVAILABLE IN LINUX) ==> REFER == "https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/netinet/in.h.html"

TERMINAL > "man bind" ==> sockaddr IS ALSO FOUND HERE 
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
                socklen_t addrlen);
TERMINAL > "man listen" ==> int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

FOR-COPY-PASTE LARGER SET OF DATA : 
REFER : "https://www.malibal.com/guides/how-to-copy-file-content-to-clipboard-on-linux/"
       
read the docs for the below code : 
man accept :

man connect :
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
                   socklen_t addrlen);
                   
man inet_addr : "inet-protocol" 
Internet networking (IN)

why htons() ? ==> man htons
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
The htons() function converts the unsigned short integer hostshort from
       host byte order to network byte order.

what is host-byte in simple words : 
Host Byte Order refers to how bytes are arranged when referring to the computer architecture of a host computing platform. Due to pervasiveness of the Intel architecture, this is generally Little Endian This means least significant byte in the smallest address in a word.

FOR PREFECT-EXPLANATION

man memset :
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);

man recv : (recieve)
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

to implement 2 way communication , we need a "pthread library" during "compile time " :
